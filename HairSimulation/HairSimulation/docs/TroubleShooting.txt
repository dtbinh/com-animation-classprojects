Q : Cannot execute after check out from svn check out? The error message shows lack of OgreMain_d.dll etc.
A : At first, copy "HairSimulation.vcproj.KUENHAN-1E28FB6.Administrator.user" to other place as backup. 
    Execute "HairSimulation.vcproj" if check out the project first time. And close the project after the project is builded.
    A new file "HairSimulation.vcproj-XXX.user" is generated in "HairSimulation\HairSimulation". (XXX is your computer's name)
    Copy the backuped file "HairSimulation.vcproj.KUENHAN-1E28FB6.Administrator.user" to working directory and rename it as "HairSimulation.vcproj-XXX.user".
