Q : Cannot execute after check out from svn check out? The error message shows lack of OgreMain_d.dll etc.
A : Execute "HairSimulation.vcproj" if check out the project first time. And close the project.
    A new file "HairSimulation.vcproj-XXX.user" is generated in "HairSimulation\HairSimulation". (XXX is your computer's name)
    Rename the file "HairSimulation.vcproj.KUENHAN-1E28FB6.Administrator.user" as "HairSimulation.vcproj-XXX.user".
